# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is the "uzi-site" project - the first website for Uzi. The repository is currently minimal with only a README.md file.

## Current State

The repository is in its initial state with no build system, dependencies, or source code yet established. Future development will likely involve setting up a web framework and development environment.

## Development Commands

No build, test, or development commands are currently configured. These will need to be established as the project grows.
